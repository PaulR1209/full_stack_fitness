## UX Design and Features

### Wireframes

These wireframes, created using Balsamiq, represent the rough layout and structure of the website. They offer a simple, visual guide to the design and functionality of key pages, helping to plan the user experience and interface before final implementation.

### Homepage

![Hero Image Screenshot](/readme/images/hero-image.png)

**Explanation:** The homepage features a prominent call-to-action (CTA) button to explore memberships. This CTA is strategically placed within the hero image to immediately engage visitors and encourage them to either sign up or learn more about membership options. The goal of this section is to convert visitors into members by clearly guiding them towards the next step in their journey.

### Membership Page

![Membership Page Screenshot](/readme/images/memberships-auth.png)

**Explanation:** Upon clicking the CTA, users are presented with the membership options in a clear, color-coded layout featuring bronze, silver, and gold tiers. This design makes it easy for users to differentiate between available membership options. For new users who are not logged in, another CTA prompting them to sign up appears underneath the membership tiers. This ensures users can only purchase a membership after signing up.

### Admin Dashboard

![Admin Dashboard Screenshot](/readme/images/admin-dashboard.png)

**Explanation** The Admin Dashboard is a page accessible only to users with admin credentials. It provides an overview of all users, with the ability to view detailed information about each user's orders by clicking the "View Details" button. While the page is currently in progress, there are plans to enhance it by adding a search filter for more efficient user lookup. Future updates will also include the ability for admins to edit and create orders on behalf of users, improving overall functionality and control.

### Login/Sign Up Page

![Sign Up Page Screenshot](/readme/images/signup.png)

![Membership page screenshot for logged in users](/readme/images/memberships.png)

**Explanation:** When users click the CTA to sign up, they are redirected to this page, where they can create an account. Authentication is handled via AllAuth, which simplifies the process for users and administrators. Once signed up, users are redirected back to the membership page, where they can now purchase a membership.

### Purchasing a Membership

![Checkout page screenshot](/readme/images/stripe-payment.png)

![Checkout success](/readme/images/payment-success.png)

**Explanation:** After selecting a membership, the user is directed to the Stripe checkout page to complete the purchase. The Stripe API handles payment processing securely. Once payment is successful, the user is redirected to a success page, which includes a link back to the membership page, confirming the transaction and membership.

### Membership Management

![Manage membership page](/readme/images/manage.png)

**Explanation:** Once a user has purchased a membership, the membership page transforms into a management interface. Here, users can update or cancel their membership, or change their payment method. This feature offers flexibility and control over their membership, making it easier for users to manage their subscriptions.

### Reviews Page

![Reviews page screenshot](/readme/images/reviews.png)

**Explanation:** The Reviews page allows users who are logged in to leave a review for the gym. Each review consists of a title, star rating, and a comment, providing valuable feedback for both the gym and other potential customers. Reviews are visible to all visitors, but only logged-in users can leave, edit, or delete their own reviews. This functionality helps build trust and community within the website, as users can see others' experiences while sharing their own.

**Sorting Functionality:** Users can sort reviews by star rating and by the newest or oldest, which makes it easy to find the most relevant or recent feedback. This sorting mechanism enhances the user experience by allowing them to navigate the reviews efficiently.

### Reviews Page for Admin

![Reviews page admin screenshot](/readme/images/admin-review.png)

**Explanation** The Admin Reviews Page allows admins to view all user-submitted reviews. Admins have the ability to edit or delete reviews as needed, providing moderation tools to ensure content remains appropriate and in line with community guidelines.

## Pop up Notifications

### Confirmation Messages

![Modal Box Screenshot](/readme/images/upgrade-modal.png)

**Explanation:** Before making any changes to a user's membership (e.g., upgrading or downgrading), a modal box appears to confirm their action. The modal includes relevant information regarding the changes, providing users with clarity and ensuring they understand what they are about to do. This modal box is built using Bootstrap's modal component.

### Django Messages

![Django messages screenshot](/readme/images/manage-cancelled.png)

**Explanation:** Whenever a user makes changes to their membership, updates their payment method, or if a payment fails, a Django message appears. These pop-up messages notify the user of successful changes or alert them to important issues, such as membership expiration or payment failure. This ensures users are always informed about the status of their account.

# Agile Development Process

For this project, I used Agile methodologies to ensure continuous improvement and effective project management. This included working in short, focused sprints to develop and test features iteratively.

- **Project Board**: I created a GitHub Project Kanban board with columns for "Backlog," "In Progress," and "Done" to track the status of each task.
- **User Stories**: Each user story was broken down into individual tasks, which were then created as issues on GitHub and moved across the project board as progress was made.
- **Continuous Feedback**: The project was reviewed regularly to ensure it aligned with user expectations and to implement improvements quickly.

See my [Project Board](https://github.com/users/PaulR1209/projects/4/views/1) here.

## Known Issues and Bugs

- **No known issues or bugs at this time**

This section will be updated if any bugs are identified in future testing or by users

## Validation

### JavaScript Type Attribute Warning

**Description:** A warning related to the type attribute in <script> tags (e.g., type="text/javascript"). This attribute is unnecessary in modern HTML5 as it is defaulted to JavaScript. This warning is not caused by any code within this project but might be coming from external resources or libraries included in the project.

**Resolution:** Since this is not related to the projectâ€™s code, no changes will be made within this project to address it.

### Charset Attribute Warning

**Description:** This error occurs when the <meta charset="utf-8"> tag appears after the first 1024 bytes in the HTML document. Like the previous warning, this is not a result of any code written in this project and may stem from external libraries or resources.

**Resolution:** Since this issue is not within the project's code, it will not be addressed here. The error is purely informational and doesn't impact functionality.

![Validation Errors](/readme/images/validation.png)

### AllAuth Issues

**Description:** There are a few errors related to the Allauth library, which are not under the direct control of this project. These errors are caused by Allauth's internal workings and cannot be fixed or modified without altering the Allauth library itself.

**Resolution:** These issues are acknowledged, but since they stem from an external package (Allauth), they are not expected to be resolved within this project. They should not affect the core functionality of the application.
